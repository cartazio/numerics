module LayoutProperties where

{-

want 

id_Tup = addr2Tup . tup2Addr

id_Addr = tup2Addr . addr2Tup

for Dense Indexors, for each dense indexor must satisfy these properties
(for every valid shape and valid index)

Sparse Indexors need the "evidence sheet" of nonzero entries 
(represented in the address space)

need to also figure out whats what for the fancy representations
